# odin-recipes
So basically I just copied recipes from random websites so that I can train some html skills for the Odin Project. 
I mainly learned how to link different pages, make unordered and ordered lists, make headings, paragraphs and how to put photos onto a webpage. 
It was quite fun at first but a bit repetitive, which is why I only put 2 recipes on my page.
